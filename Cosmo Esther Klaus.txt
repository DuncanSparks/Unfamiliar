< Why are you two so worried?

> We don't want to be witches. We don't care about that stuff.
> But our mom does witch stuff all day.
> It feels like she hardly has time for us anymore.
> If she creates a familiar...
> What if she just forgets about us?
< I already told you.
< Familiars aren't supposed to be family.

< I'm always worried, too.
< I just want her to love me.
< But I need to get that stupid hope out of my head, because I'm not her family.

> Why wouldn't you be?

> Why wouldn't familiars be family to their witches?
< ...
> I mean, it's literally in the name! Familiar! Family!
> Right?
< ...
< That's only because we have a part of their soul inside of us.
> Is that how familiars work?
< Yeah.
> That sounds like you're family to me!
< It does sound like it.
< But it takes more than that.
< Can you really be family to someone if you don't know their name?
> You... don't know your witch's name?
< No. We aren't allowed to.
< It's part of the contract.
> ...
> Wait... contract? What contract?
< The contract that binds me to my witch.
< I have to follow her orders, and she has to protect me.
< That's not family. That's just us doing what the contract tells us to.
