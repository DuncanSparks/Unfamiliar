Cosmo: ...Why are you wearing sunglasses down here?

"Witch" A: Gah! How did you find us?
"Witch" B: Our hideout has been discovered!
"Witch" C: Wait...
"Witch" D: Oh my god... is that a familiar?

Cosmo: Uh... hi?
"Witch" A: Are you a familiar?
Cosmo: Um... yes?
"Witch" A: I knew it! He's a familiar!
Cosmo: They.
"Witch" A: They're a familiar!

Cosmo: Who are you, exactly?
"Witch" A: Only the greatest group of aspiring witches in the city.
"Witch" B: We're the Witchcraft Club!
"Witch" C: From Los Muertos High.
Cosmo: Oh...
Cosmo: And this is your meeting place?
Cosmo: The sewers?
"Witch" A: Yes! It's our secret hideout.
"Witch" A: Nobody would ever think to come down here.
"Witch" D: Except a familiar, apparently.
Cosmo: I'm looking for someone.
"Witch" B: In the sewers?
Cosmo: ...
Cosmo: ...Okay, look -- I'm kind of desperate.
