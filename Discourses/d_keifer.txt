< I like cooking.
@< explain2
< I make dinner for me and my witch a lot of the time.
> Wow. That must be nice. I can't cook to save my life.
@< smile
> Who taught you?
< My witch. She's really good at cooking.
> What's her favorite thing to make?
< Gumbo. She has her own recipe.
> Wow, really?
> I didn't think people ate gumbo around here.
@< heh
< We're probably the exception and not the rule.
@< smile
> What about you? What's your favorite thing to cook?
@< explain2
< I have this really great stuffed pepper recipe.
@< satisfied
< My witch always says it's one of the best things she's ever eaten.
< Pretty impressive, right?
> Yeah.
@< smile
> ...
> Man, I wish I could cook...

< I play a few instruments.
> Really? Which ones?
< My favorite is my ocarina.
< I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.
> Huh... that's not an instrument you see every day.
> What else do you play?
@< explain2
< Mostly piano. We have one at home.
> Have you taken piano lessons?
< A few. I've also learned a bit from my witch.
> Nice.
> My mom wanted me to take piano lessons a while back.
> I was never that interested, though.
< I'm also in the process of learning flute.
@< heh
< I'm not very good, but I'm getting there.
> Man... you sound talented!
@< smile
> Your witch must be proud of you.
@< idle
< ...
< Yeah.

> Hey, Cosmo...
@< smile
< Yeah?
> I have a question.
@< idle
> You're a demon, but...
> Why do you look so much like a human?
@< think
< $wWell...
@< idle
< This might take a bit of explanation.
< On how familiars are created, I mean.
> I'm listening!
< Okay, so...
@< explain
< To create a familiar, you need three things.
< First, you need to know the actual spell that does it.
< I think it draws energy from the underworld, or something.
> All right.
< When she created me, my witch had been practicing witchcraft for about fifteen years.
@< smile
< And she says it took her...
@< heh
< Four months to learn the spell.
> What?!
< It's $sreally $0complicated.
> Yeah... must be.
@< idle
< Anyway.
@< explain
< Next, you need to actually give your familiar life.
< And you do that with a piece of your own soul.
> Your soul? You mean, like... give your familiar a piece of your soul?
> How do you even do that?
@< smile
< You just tear out a piece of your own soul.
> $sWhat?!
@< idle
< Yeah. My witch says it's... not pleasant.
> ...
@< explain2
< And the last thing you need is a vessel.
@< smile
< Some kind of object or memento to act as a host for the familiar.
@< idle
< The vessel you use determines the appearance and form your familiar will take.
> Oh... I see.
@< explain
< Yeah. If you use something like a pendant or trinket, they'll probably be a shapeless shadow.
@< idle
< But, in my case... my witch probably used a doll, or something. She hasn't actually told me.
@< smile
< So, that's why I look kinda like a human.
> That's pretty cool!
@< idle
> Can you make your cat your familiar, or something?
@< angry2
< $wNo!
@< idle
< The vessel you use has to be something without a soul.
@< explain
< Because you're giving part of your own soul to it to make it your familiar.
@< idle
> Okay. That makes sense.
> Sort of.
> Man, bein' a witch sounds $wcomplicated.
< Mhm.
< Being a familiar is even $wmore $0complicated.
> ...

> Cosmo, do you...
> ...
< Hm?
> Never mind.
< No, go ahead!
> ...
> Do you like being a demon?
< ...
@< smile
< I mean... yeah!
@< idle
< It's not always easy, though.
@< sad
< A lot of people don't like demons.
> What? Why?
< I don't know.

[STUFF]

> What type of magic do you use?
< Fire magic. The same as my witch.
> Oh.
> Isn't fire magic used for, like...
> $wKilling people?
@< idle
< I mean... you $wcould.
< If you wanted to be a horrible person and make everyone hate you.
@< explain2
< But fire magic also has a lot of more practical uses.
< Like, for example... imagine never having to buy a box of matches in your life.
< Need to light the fireplace? Just use fire magic.
< Birthday candles? Fire magic.
< Lost your flashlight? Make a flame in your hand and use it for light.
@< smile
> Huh... I never thought about it that way.
@< idle
< And... you can also use it for self-defense, of course.
