< I'm not a $wreal $0demon. I'm a familiar.
< Familiars are pretty much half-demon, half-human.

@< smile
< This is gonna take a $sbit $0of explanation.
@> idle
> I'm listening!
@< idle
< Okay, so...
@< explain
< To create a familiar, you need three things.
@> serious
< First, you need to know the actual spell that does it.
< I think it draws energy from the underworld, or something.
> All right.
< When she created me, my witch had been practicing witchcraft for about fifteen years.
@< think
< And she says it took her about...
@< heh
< Four months to learn the spell.
@> shock
> What?!
< It's $sreally $0complicated.
@> serious
> Yeah... must be.
@< idle
< Anyway.
@< explain
< Next, you need to actually give your familiar life.
< And you do that with a piece of your own soul.
> Your soul? You mean, like... give your familiar a piece of your soul?
> How do you even do that?
@< heh
< You just tear out a piece of your own soul.
@> shock
> $sWhat?!
@< idle
< Yeah. My witch says it's... not pleasant.
@> serious
> ...
@< explain2
< And the last thing you need is a vessel.
@< smile
< Some kind of object or memento to act as a host for the familiar.
@< idle
< It has to be something that's really important to you. Otherwise the spell won't work.
@< glare
< I'm not sure why it works that way. I guess it helps bind your soul to it, or something.
@< idle
< So, basically, to create a familiar, you have to give up both a part of your soul and a memento that's important to you.
@< sad
< It's a lot.
> ...Yeah. Wow.
@< idle
> What did your witch use to create you?
< I'm honestly not sure. She never told me.
> Oh...
@> explain2
> Does the vessel determine the appearance a familiar takes?
< Uh... maybe a $wlittle $0bit.
@> serious
< It's mostly dependent on the witch and their personality.
< I mean, they're infusing the vessel with their own soul.
@> idle
> That's pretty cool.
> Can you make your cat your familiar, or something?
< No.
@> serious
@< explain
< The vessel you use has to be something without a soul.
> Oh.
> ...
@> edgy
> What if your cat was...
@> serious
@< angry2
< $sNo! $0Of course not!
