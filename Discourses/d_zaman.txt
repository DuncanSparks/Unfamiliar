@< sad
> What's your name, kid?
< Cosmo.
> Ah. Your witch picked a nice name for you.
> I'm Zaman. Nice to meet you, Cosmo.
< ...
> So... what did you say you forgot about?
< Communion Day.
> Communion Day...
> I don't know that much about witches. Is that a day that they celebrate?
< Yes. Witches and their familiars.
@< idle
< It's sort of an anniversary. It's the day a witch created their familiar.
< Like I said, she created me eight years ago today.
> Really? You don't look eight.
< We don't age like humans. It's complicated.
> Oh... okay.
> So, what happens on on Communion Day?
> Is it sort of like a birthday?
< No.
< There's a tradition for it that most witches follow.
@< explain
< It's supposed to be a celebration of the bond between a witch and their familiar.
< It's always started by the familiar.
< The familiar gives a gift to their witch.
@< idle
< It doesn't have to be anything special. Just a little token of gratitude.
< It's to show their witch thanks for summoning them into this world and granting them life.
< Then the witch gives their familiar a gift, too.
< It's to say thanks to their familiar for serving them and being their companion.
@< sad
< Then they spend the rest of the day doing their favorite activities together.
< The witch isn't supposed to give their familiar any orders throughout the day.
< It's a way of representing that, even though we serve our witches, we aren't any less than them.
@< idle
< We're a part of each other. We need each other.
> That's... really wonderful.
@< sad
< Yeah. Not all witches practice Communion Day, though.
< And, of course... you can't practice Communion Day if the familiar doesn't acknowledge it.
> The witch can't remind them, or anything?
< Nope. That's part of the tradition.
< And I ruined it. I forgot.
< I've ruined it multiple times.
< I'm such an awful familiar.
> Cosmo... Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone forgets things.
> It's not the end of the world.
@< angry2
< Yes it $sIS!
< You don't understand!
@< angry
< It's not like forgetting to wish someone a happy birthday, Zaman.
< If you're a familiar, forgetting to acknowledge Communion Day is one of the most disrespectful things you can do to your witch.
< It's like telling them that you don't appreciate them.
@< sad
< That your eternal contract and bond means nothing.
< Like you hate each other, even...
< And I forgot! $sAGAIN!
< I've forgotten so many times, and she's gotten so mad at me every time, and I $sSTILL $0managed to forget!
< $sWhat's wrong with me...?
< $sIt's bad enough that we got separated at the train station.
< $sNow we've missed Communion Day again.
< $sAnd it's all my fault.
> Wait... you two got separated?
< Yeah.
< The train was full. I had to wait for a later one.
< I looked for her all night. I looked all over the city.
< I never found her.
> Cosmo-
< Maybe she doesn't even want me to find her.
< I've forgotten so many times, she probably wants nothing to do with me anymore.
> Cosmo...
> It sure sounds to me like you appreciate your witch.
< Why?
> You've been searching for her all night.
> That sounds to me like you care.
@< angry
< I'm her familiar.
< I have to care about her. I'm bound to serve her for eternity.
> Are you saying you're only searching for her because you have to?
> If you weren't her familiar, would you even be looking for her?
> Is that the only reason you care?
@< angry2
< $sNO!
< Of $scourse $0it isn't!
>> Then why did you spend all night looking for her?

@< angry
< You should see what it's like back in Flagstaff.
< It happens practically every single time we leave the house.
< People treat her like trash. Just for being a witch.
< They treat me like trash, too, but that's beyond the point.
< Nothing too horrible has ever happened, but that's because we can protect each other.
