> What's your name, kid?
< Cosmo.
> Your witch picked a nice name for you.
> I'm Zaman. Nice to meet you, Cosmo.
< Mhm.
< ...
> So... what did you say you forgot about?
< Communion Day.
> Communion Day...
> I don't know that much about witches. Is that a day that they celebrate?
< Witches and their familiars.
< It's sort of an anniversary. It's the day a witch created their familiar.
< Like I said, she created me eight years ago today.
> Really? You don't look eight.
< We don't age like humans. It's complicated.
> Oh... okay.
> So, what happens on on Communion Day?
> Is it sort of like a birthday?
< No.
< There's a tradition for it that most witches follow.
< It's supposed to be a celebration of the bond between a witch and their familiar.
< It's always started by the familiar.
< The familiar gives a gift to their witch.
< It doesn't have to be anything special. Just a little token of gratitude.
< To show their witch thanks for summoning them into this world and granting them life.
< Then the witch gives their familiar a gift, too.
< To say thanks to their familiar for serving them and being their companion.
< Then the two of them spend the day together.
