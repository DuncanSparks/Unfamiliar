@< sad
> What's your name, kid?
< Cosmo.
> Ah. Your witch picked a nice name for you.
> I'm Zaman. Nice to meet you, Cosmo.
< ...
> So... what did you say you forgot about?
< Communion Day.
> Communion Day...
> I don't know that much about witches. Is that a day that they celebrate?
< Yes. Witches and their familiars.
@< idle
< It's sort of an anniversary. It's the day a witch created their familiar.
< Like I said, she created me twelve years ago today.
> Really? You don't look twelve.
< We don't age like humans. It's complicated.
> Oh. okay.
> So, what happens on on Communion Day?
> Is it sort of like a birthday?
< No.
@< explain
< It's supposed to be a celebration of the bond between a witch and their familiar.
< It starts with the two of them giving each other a gift.
@< idle
< It doesn't have to be anything special. Just a little token of gratitude.
< The familiar shows their witch thanks for summoning them into this world and granting them life.
< And the witch shows their familiar thanks for serving them and being their companion.
@< sad
< Then they spend the rest of the day doing their favorite activities together.
< The witch isn't supposed to give their familiar any orders throughout the day.
< It's a way of representing that, even though we serve our witches, we aren't any less than them.
@< idle
< We're a part of each other. We need each other.
> That's... really wonderful.
@< sad
< Yeah. Not all witches practice Communion Day, though.
< And, of course... you can't celebrate Communion Day if you just forget about it.
> Wait... couldn't your $wwitch $0have forgotten about it?
> Was she really busy today? Maybe she forgot, too.
@< angry
< No.
< She wouldn't forget.
< She never forgets.
@< sad
< Every single year, she's done something wonderful for me on Communion Day.
< And I've never been able to live up to it on my end.
< I have a feeling she's tired of that.
< I bet she was testing me.
< She wanted me to acknowledge Communion Day myself this time.
< She wanted to make sure I wasn't forgetting about it.
< And I DID!
@< sad2
< I FORGOT!
@< sad
> Cosmo, I hate to ask, but...
> Is it $wreally $0that big a deal that you forgot about it?
@< angry2
< YES! It is!
< You don't understand!
@< angry
< Forgetting about Communion Day is one of the most disrespectful things you can do.
< It's like telling your witch that you don't appreciate them.
< That your eternal bond means nothing.
< She wanted to make sure that I knew that. And I couldn't even show it.
@< sad
< I've screwed so many things up, but at least I'd never forgotten about Communion Day.
< And now I've screwed that up, too.
@< sad2
< $s...
< $sWhat's wrong with me...?
@< sad
< It's bad enough that we got separated at the train station.
< Now we didn't even get to celebrate our most important tradition.
< And it's all my fault.
< God, I'm such an awful familiar...
> Wait... you two got separated?
< Yeah.
< The train was full. I had to wait for a later one.
< I looked for her all night. I looked all over the city.
< I never found her.
> Cosmo-
< She probably doesn't even want me to find her.
< She has to stop forgiving me at some point.
> Cosmo...
> You sure don't sound like an awful familiar to me.
< Why?
> You've been searching for her all night.
> That sounds to me like you care.
< That doesn't make me a good person.
@< angry
< I don't have a choice. I have to care about her.
< I'm bound to serve her for eternity.
> Are you saying you're only searching for her because you have to?
> If you weren't her familiar, would you even be looking for her?
> Is that the only reason you care?
@< angry2
< $sNO!
< Of $scourse $0it isn't!
>> Then why did you spend all night looking for her?

< I'm worried about her!
< Do you have any idea what people do to witches?
^ 
@< angry
< You should see what it's like back in Flagstaff.
< It happens practically every single time we leave the house.
< People treat her like trash. Just for being a witch.
< They treat me like trash, too, but that's beyond the point.
< Nothing too horrible has ever happened, but that's because we can protect each other.
@< sad
< Now she's alone. And we $scan't $0protect each other.
> Wait... witches don't usually dress any different than non-witches, do they?
< No.
> But people can still tell she's a witch?
@< angry2
< Yes!
< It's just a thing that people can figure out.
< I'm the same way.
< You could take these horns off me, and people would still know I'm a demon.
< Witches and demons just have an $sair $0to them.
< We're horrifying fountains of darkness and despair.
@< sad
< And people hate us for it.
< We've never been to Los Muertos before. I don't know what kind of people are here.
< There could be people here who will kill her.
< And if that happens, I...

> You're not an awful familiar.

> I've visited Los Muertos a few times.
> There are obviously some bad people here, but...
> It's a city full of monsters, demons, and lots of witches. Most people here are probably fine with them.
> And, I mean... she's a $wwitch. $0She can defend herself, right?
< Well... yeah.
> I think you should stop worrying.

@< sad
< I feel awful. I'm so stupid.
< I'm an idiot. An abomination.
> Cosmo, stop it!
@< angry2
< No! It's who I am!
@< angry
< And my witch knows it just as well as I do.
< If she hasn't already stopped forgiving me, she's going to at some point.
@< sad
< But I'm not letting myself not apologize.
< Even if she doesn't forgive me.
< Even if she hates me forever.
< I just want her to know I'm sorry.

> Cosmo, if you care this much about making things right, I don't think you're an awful familiar.
< There's no need to make things right if you don't screw them up in the first place.
> Cosmo, snap out of it!
< ...What?
> You forgot one day of the year. You made a human mistake.
@< sad
< I'm not-
> I know you aren't human. But you have a body and a soul, so I'm calling you human.
> Humans make mistakes. Your witch makes mistakes, too.
> If she doesn't accept your apology and hates you forever, that's her problem.
> Because, well... she's kind of stuck with you.
@< idle
> Tell her you're sorry, but don't let her knock you down for making a mistake.
@< sad

@< idle
< You're right.
< I'm stuck with her, and she's stuck with me. We can't stay mad at each other forever.
< We have to understand each other.
< It's like the pact said: we're a part of each other.
< I'm gonna go find her and tell her I'm sorry.
< And then I'll give her a hug.
< And if she doesn't hug me back... that's fine.
< I'll just hug her even harder.
