< Your name's Yaga, right?
> How'd you know that, hamster hair?
< It says on your sandwich wrapper.
> ...
> Figures.
> Okay, familiar...
@< glare
< My name's Cosmo.
@< idle
> Fine. Cosmo.
> Tell me about this witch of yours.
< Why?
> I know this city in and out. I know where people tend to end up.
< ...Okay.
>> How much of a socialite is she, exactly?
[ 11 She's very social. (0, -60)[17, 30] | 11 A little bit. (0, -60)[17, 30] | 11 She's a real recluse. (0, -60)[17, 30]
< She's very social.
< I get dragged to social outings with her a lot.
< She seems really eager to show everyone she has a familiar.
> Oh, brother...
> There's nothing special about having a familiar.
< Gee, thanks.
> That wasn't a jab at you, honeybucket. That was a jab at your witch.
> Do you see me $wflaunting $0the fact that I'm a witch? Nope.
> It's nothing to flaunt about. Everyone's a witch nowadays.
< Is that how you feel about demons?
> Don't ask me loaded questions, hamster hair.
> I've got no problems with you. That's all you should care about.

========================
<< Hey, Yaga...
[ 11 Have you ever had a familiar? (0, -60)[17, 30] | 11 Do you like being a witch? (0, -60)[17, 30] | 11 Why are you eating at this restaurant? (0, -60)[17, 30]
------------------------
< Have you ever had a familiar?
> Nope. Never have, never will.
> I don't have the time or energy for that. It's way more trouble than it's worth.
< ...
> It's like having a kid.
< What? It's not-
> ...A kid bound to you by a contract of the underworld, who happens to be at your eternal servitude.
< Yep. $wThat's $0more like it.
> Okay, look, hamster hair: even if you have a magical personal assistant, it's one more mouth to feed.
> It's one more person to care for.
< Oh, and you think all witches care whether their familiars are happy?
> Of course not! I know they don't! This world is full of awful people! I'm pretty damn awful myself!
> ...
> But they should care.
> We make contracts with you demons. We drag you into our world.
> You have just as much right to be here as us.
< ...
< I'm glad you think so.
------------------------
< Do you like being a witch?
> Ugh...
< Sorry. Should I have-
> I hate it! It was the worst choice I ever made!
> What genius thought it should be a permanent decision?
> I was a fifteen-year-old girl who was fascinated with demons and the underworld.
> It was a fad. I chained myself to the underworld because of a fad.
> And once I realized I'd thrown my life away, I couldn't go back.
> You're a demon. You know what it's like. Everyone's terrified of you.
> Can't even order a lousy sandwich without the cashier shaking a bit.
< Yeah...
> Although, it $wdoes $0have its perks.
> Nobody'll bother you when you're eating dinner at the worst restaurant in town.
> Except talkative demons, apparently.
< Heh...
------------------------
< Why are you eating at this restaurant?
< You keep talking about how terrible it is.
> You aren't from Los Muertos, are you?
< Nope.
> Well, let me tell you about this town's restaurants.
> They're all too expensive. Five-star. $wLudicrously $0overpriced.
> You can't blame them. Los Muertos has always been a tourist attraction.
> "The city of the dead!"#"Home of witches and demons and twisted monsters!"#"The thread that ties the mortal realm to the underworld!"
> In other words, if you want to go out to eat in this town, you have two choices:
> Empty your wallet for some divine-grade five-star food,
> or go to $wDell's Delicatessen.
> This place sucks. They have the worst sandwiches I've ever eaten.
> But I don't have to mortgage my house to eat here, so I'm gonna eat here.
> I usually cook at home, anyway.
