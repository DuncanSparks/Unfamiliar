@< heh
< It's a lot more complicated than that. But that's the gist of it.
@< idle

> A familiar having glasses seems... kind of odd.
@> idle2
< Yeah.
@< explain
< It was a long time ago, but I was just... having problems with my vision.
< I don't remember when it started, but it made doing work really difficult.
@< idle
< Or... doing $wanything $0really difficult.
@< sad2
< Before I told my witch about it, I was afraid she'd something like...
< $w"That's just something that happens to familiars sometimes."
< Or, $w"You're a familiar; there's no doctor who could help with that."
@< idle
< But... she brought me straight to her eye doctor that week.
< And after $wa lot $0of bargaining, she convinced her eye doctor to give me a quick eye exam.
@< smile
< And she ended up prescribing me glasses.
> Wow... that's really sweet.
@< idle
> Can she... $wdo $0that?
< Uh...
< I mean... familiars aren't $wtoo $0different from humans.
@< glare
< ...Okay, we kind of are. Especially familiars that are less human-like than me.
@< idle
< But I guess her eye doctor eventually decided she could try to help me.

@< idle
< She gave me an education.
> Oh, really?
@< explain
< Yeah. She homeschooled me for about eight years.
@< idle
< Nothing fancy. Just up to a high school level.
@< smile
< But I really enjoyed it. She taught me pretty well.
> Is she required to do that?
@< idle
< Actually, yes. Witches are required by law to educate their familiars.
< That's been a thing for a while, actually.
@< explain
< Almost all witches end up homeschooling their familiars.
< I guess they don't like the idea of leaving their familiars alone for the whole day.
@< idle
< Some witches do send their familiars to public school, though.
> Really?
> I never saw a single familiar when I was in school.
< I mean a $sreally $0small number of witches.
< And there aren't even too many witches in the first place.
> Yeah. That makes sense.
> ...
> Couldn't a familiar just... burn down the whole school, or something?
@< sad2
< $wThat's $0why so few witches do it. A lot of witches wouldn't trust their familiars that much.
> ...
> Does your witch not trust you?
< I feel like she was just worried about me being alone.
< I'd like to think she trusts me.
< At least, I hope she does.

@< smile2

< That was $wprobably $0the biggest relief of my life.
@< smile
> So, she's done a lot to help you with that?
@< idle
< Yeah.
@< sad2
< Sometimes I'm pretty shy about correcting people.

< But she always makes an effort to do that if we're in public and someone gets it wrong.

< Okay, so...
< One of the core talents witches have is summoning demons.
@< idle
< Real demons, I mean. Not familiars.
< So, naturally, the way you become a witch is by summoning a demon.

@< explain
< Oh, you don't $wneed $0magic to summon a demon. You can also do it with some... clever occult trickery.
