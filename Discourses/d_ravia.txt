< Why are you here with your uncle?
> ...
> My parents sent me here.
> They said I wasn't doing enough with my life.
> I mean... I spent five years in college getting a bachelor's in anthropology, but that hasn't amounted to anything.
> So they made me come and work under my uncle in Los Muertos until I can find a better job.
> I think they just wanted me out of the house more than anything.
@< sad
< So you don't get along with your parents?
> Not really. There's a lot of hot water between us.
> Getting out of the house for a while might not have been the worst thing.
@< idle
< How's your uncle?
> He's... all right?
> He's kind of weird sometimes.
> And he's $sextremely $0dedicated to his work.
> Living up to his expectations isn't gonna be any easier than with my parents.
> But he's nice enough. A lot more patient than my parents, that's for sure.
> Still, though... this is gonna be a $wlong $0few months.

< What do you think of Los Muertos?
> I'm... not a fan.
> I know some people like small, strange towns like this, but it's not my thing.
> I don't have anything against witches or demons, though.
> There's something really neat about seeing them walking around every day.
> I just... kinda miss the big city.
< Where are you from?
> Up north a ways.
> It's a pretty crowded city. But, honestly... I kind of like that.
> There's always people to talk to. And there's always something going on.
> Los Muertos is...
> Well, I guess it isn't a very well-kept secret anymore, since so many people visit here nowadays.
> But they're just $wvisiting. $0They're not interested in getting to know anyone here.
> I don't know. It just doesn't feel like home.
@< sad
< Yeah. I know what you mean.
@< idle
< Do you miss your parents, too?
> ...
> I... don't know.
> We weren't on the best terms. They're probably glad that I'm out of the house for a while.
> But... I'd feel bad if I said I didn't miss them at all.
> I should really call sometime and see how they're doing.

> What about you, Cosmo?
< Huh?
> What's your relationship with your witch like?
> I haven't really talked to any familiars, so I don't know how that all works.
> I know about the name thing, but not much else.
< Well...
@< smile
< My witch is really nice.
> Really?
@< explain
< Yeah. A lot of the time, it doesn't really feel like I'm her $wassistant, $0or whatever you'd say a familiar is.
< I just... help her. That's really all it is.
@< idle
> Sounds pretty simple.
@< heh
< It's a lot more complicated than that. But that's the gist of it.
@< idle
< It's not a one-way agreement, either.
@< explain
< Part of the contract is that the witch does everything in their power to protect their familiar.
@< idle
< And, yeah. My witch has always done that.
@< smile2
< But she's also just... done a lot of really nice things for me.
> Really? Like what?
@< think
<< Well, for example...

@< idle
< She helped me get these glasses.
> Oh, yeah. I was thinking about that.
> A familiar having glasses seems... kind of odd.
< Yeah.
@< explain
< It was a long time ago, but I was just... having problems with my vision.
< I don't remember when it started, but it made doing work really difficult.
@< idle
< Or... doing $wanything $0really difficult.
@< sad2
< Before I told my witch about it, I was afraid she'd something like...
< $w"That's just something that happens to familiars sometimes," $0or $w"You're a familiar; there's no doctor who could help with that."
@< idle
< But... she brought me straight to her eye doctor that week.
< And after $wa lot $0of bargaining, she convinced her eye doctor to give me a quick eye exam.
@< smile
< And she ended up prescribing me glasses.
> Wow.
@< idle
> That's really sweet, but, like... can she $wdo $0that?
< Uh...
< I mean... familiars aren't $wtoo $0different from humans.
@< glare
< ...Okay, we kind of are. Especially familiars that are less human-like than me.
@< idle
< But I guess her eye doctor eventually decided she could try to help me.
@< smile
< And she did. And I'm really thankful for it.
> ...
> I'm glad there are people like her out there.
< Yeah.

@< idle
< She gave me an education.
> Oh, really?
@< explain
< Yeah. She homeschooled me for about eight years.
@< idle
< Nothing fancy. Just up to a high school level.
@< smile
< But I really enjoyed it. She taught me pretty well.
> Is she required to do that?
@< idle
< Actually, yes. Witches are required by law to educate their familiars.
< That's been a thing for a while, actually.
@< explain
< Almost all witches end up homeschooling their familiars.
< I guess they don't like the idea of leaving their familiars alone for the whole day.
@< idle
< Some witches do send their familiars to public school, though.
> Really?
> I never saw a single familiar when I was in school.
< I mean a $sreally $0small number of witches.
< And there aren't even too many witches in the first place.
> Yeah. That makes sense.
> ...
> Couldn't a familiar just... burn down the whole school, or something?
@< sad2
< $wThat's $0why so few witches do it. A lot of witches wouldn't trust their familiars that much.
> ...
> Does your witch not trust you?
< I feel like she was just worried about me being alone.
