< Why are you here with your uncle?
> ...
> My parents sent me here.
> They said I wasn't doing enough with my life.
> I mean... I spent five years in college getting a bachelor's in anthropology, but that hasn't amounted to anything.
> So they made me come and work under my uncle in Los Muertos until I can find a better job.
> I think they just wanted me out of the house more than anything.
@< sad
< So you don't get along with your parents?
> Not really. There's a lot of hot water between us.
> Getting out of the house for a while might not have been the worst thing.
@< idle
< How's your uncle?
> He's... all right?
> He's kind of weird sometimes.
> And he's $sextremely $0dedicated to his work.
> Living up to his expectations isn't gonna be any easier than with my parents.
> But he's nice enough. A lot more patient than my parents, that's for sure.
> Still, though... this is gonna be a $wlong $0few months.

< What do you think of Los Muertos?
> I'm... not a fan.
> I know some people like small, strange towns like this, but it's not my thing.
> I don't have anything against witches or demons, though.
> There's something really neat about seeing them walking around every day.
> I just... kinda miss the big city.
< Where are you from?
> St. George. It's up north a ways.
