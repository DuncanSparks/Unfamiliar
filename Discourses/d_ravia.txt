@> idle2
< Yeah.
@< explain
< It was a long time ago, but I was just... having problems with my vision.
< I don't remember when it started, but it made doing work really difficult.

< Or... doing $wanything $0really difficult.
@< sad2
< Before I told my witch about it, I was afraid she'd something like...
< $w"That's just something that happens to familiars sometimes."

< I mean... familiars aren't $wtoo $0different from humans.

@< idle
< She gave me an education.

@< explain
< Yeah. She homeschooled me for about eight years.
@< idle
< Nothing fancy. Just up to a high school level.
@< smile
< But I really enjoyed it. She taught me pretty well.
> Is she required to do that?
@< idle
< Actually, yes. Witches are required by law to educate their familiars.
< That's been a thing for a while, actually.
@< explain
< Almost all witches end up homeschooling their familiars.
< I guess they don't like the idea of leaving their familiars alone for the whole day.
@< idle
< Some witches do send their familiars to public school, though.
> Really?
> I never saw a single familiar when I was in school.
< I mean a $sreally $0small number of witches.
< And there aren't even too many witches in the first place.
> Yeah. That makes sense.

> Couldn't a familiar just... burn down the whole school, or something?
@< sad2
< $wThat's $0why so few witches do it. A lot of witches wouldn't trust their familiars that much.

> Does your witch not trust you?

< Okay, so...
< One of the core talents witches have is summoning demons.
@< idle
< Real demons, I mean. Not familiars.
< So, naturally, the way you become a witch is by summoning a demon.
> How do you do that if you can't use magic until you're a witch?
@< explain
< Oh, you don't $wneed $0magic to summon a demon. You can also do it with some... clever occult trickery.
< I won't go into the details. There are books that explain it way better than I could.
< But, basically, you have to summon a demon, and they'll give you the power of witchcraft.
< By briefly possessing you.
> What?!
@< idle
< Yeah.

@> think
> That seems... weirdly easy?

< I mean... a lot of people hate witches.

< I guess people are worried a witch will summon a demon and order them to destroy a whole city, or something.

< There are laws to follow.
@> idle
> I kind of figured.
> Do they all relate to magic?
< Yep. Pretty much.
@< glare
< Unfortunately, they're also pretty vague and skewed against witches.
@< explain
< Basically, they're all about regulating the use of magic in public.
@< idle
< You can use magic in public as long as...
@< think
< What were the terms they used...
@< glare
< As long as it's not considered to be a "threat to public safety or wellbeing."
< And as long as it doesn't "disturb the peace of mind of any individual."
< So, basically, if someone declares that your magic makes them uncomfortable, they can just sue you for using it.
> Wow. That sucks.
@< idle
< Yeah. So it's best not to risk using magic in public.
@< explain
< And, obviously, using magic for assault is an automatic felony.
> They $wreally $0aren't fans of witches using magic, are they?

< Nope.
@< idle
< Y'know, it's the powers of the underworld. Of course people hate to see it.
