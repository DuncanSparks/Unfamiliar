[ 55 Salem, up north. (0, -60)[15, 25] | Zzyzx, to the west. (-90, -10)[27, 40] | Cottonwood, to the east. (70, -10)[42, 53]
------------------------
< Salem, up north.
< They don't really like witches and#demons up there.
< Our house almost got burned down.
@< sad
< Three times.
@< idle
< It's nice and cool, though.
< There are lots of trees. It's really#pretty.
> Have you ever considered moving?
< Not really. My witch has lived there#her whole life. It means too much to#her.
> I see...
------------------------
< Zzyzx, to the west.
> What a strange name!
@< smile
< Heh. Yeah.
< It's a small town in the middle of the#desert.
< The people there are pretty nice.
@< idle
< Although... $wweird $0people and#creatures pass through town#sometimes.
< And it's $shot. $0In the 90s all the time.
> What?!
< Farenheit.
> Oh. Right.
> Don't demons like it to be hot, or#something?
< I could take it or leave it.
------------------------
< Cottonwood, to the east.
> Oh, that's pretty close!
@< smile
< Yeah. We actually visit Los Muertos#a lot.
@< idle
< Cottonwood is just so boring.
< At least, I think so. I don't know if#my witch cares.
> Isn't Cottonwood the town with the#world's largest ball of paperclips?
< Yes.
@< heh
< It gets a lot less interesting after#the first time you look at it.
> Okay, that's fair.
@< smile
========================
<< Hey, Rhona...
[ 104 Where are you from? (-20, -60)[59, 69] | Why are you visiting Los Muertos? (20, -10)[71, 85] | Where are your parents? (0, 40)[87, 102]
------------------------
< Where are you from?
> I'm from Phoenix.
@< smile
< Wow, really? That's a big city.
> Yep! I'm not sure how much I like it,#though.
@< idle
> People aren't too nice in that city.#Everyone's always irritated about#something.
> I mean, it's pretty beautiful, but...#it also just $wfeels $0crummy.#I'm not sure why.
> I think Los Muertos is a lot more fun.
@< smile
< I can see why!
------------------------
< Why are you visiting Los Muertos?
> I come here every few months to visit#my grandpa.
> He works here as a fletcher.#Ainsley's Fletching.
@< smile
< Oh, that place?
@< explain2
< My witch and I usually walk past it.
< I always look through the windows.
> Yeah. My grandpa is a wizard.
@< smile
< Really?
> A wizard at interior decorating.
@< laugh
< Ha!
@< smile
------------------------
< Where are your parents?
> They're not here. I usually come to#Los Muertos by myself.
> My dad passed away a few years ago.
@< sad
< Oh...
> And my mom...
@< idle
> She really doesn't like to see my#grandpa.
> They disagree on a lot of things.
@< sad
< That must be hard.
> Yeah.
> She also just doesn't like Los#Muertos.
@< idle
> She says it's too... $wesoteric $0for her.
< I guess that's understandable.
========================
> Hey, Cosmo.
> You said you were a familiar, right?
@< idle
< Yeah.
> What does that mean, exactly?
@< whatnow
< Well, uh...
@< explain
< My witch just... $wcreated $0me, because#she wanted a personal assistant.
> I thought all demons were from the...#underworld, or something?
< Not exactly. It's really complicated.
> Oh. All right.
@< idle
>> So, what does your witch $wdo, $0exactly?
[ 168 She teaches people magic. (-20, -60)[120, 136] | She makes and sells potions. (20, -10)[138, 151] | She writes books of hexes. (0, 40)[153, 166]
------------------------
< She teaches people magic.
> Wait... you can just $wteach $0people#magic?
> I thought you had to be born a witch,#or something.
< Surprisingly not. Anyone can#become a witch with enough#training.
@< heh
< Anyone human, that is.
> Does she teach at a school?
@< smile
< Nope. She homeschools kids in our#town who want to learn magic.
> And what about you? Has she taught#you magic?
@< satisfied
< Oh, there's no need for that.#I already know magic.
@< smile
> $wWOOW! $0That was cool!
> Maybe I should become a witch.
@< heh
< Uh... might want to think about that#for a while.
------------------------
< She makes and sells potions.
@< explain2
< Healing potions, enhancement#potions...
> $wLove $0potions?
@< smile
< No. Those are only in movies.
> Oh.
> What does she make them with?
@< think
< Uh... lots of weird ingredients I#don't know anything about.
< I don't even know if she gets all her#ingredients legally.
@< heh
< ...Don't tell her I told you that.
> My lips are sealed!
------------------------
< She writes books of hexes.
@< explain2
< You can't cast a spell without#knowing how, after all.
> So... books of magic words?
< Not exactly. They're more like#pentagrams. Patterns you have to#know.
> Do you... $wdraw $0them somewhere?
@< explain
< You can.
@< think
< Or you can think about them $wreally#$0hard. It takes practice to do that,#though.
@< idle
> Interesting!
> Is she a good writer?
< Yeah. She has a real way with words.

@< smile
<< What about you, Rhona?
[ 169 What do you like to do? (-20, -60)[139, 153] | What kind of job do you want to have? (20, 60)[155, 167]
------------------------
< What do you like to do?
> I'm really into computers.
@< smile
< Really?
> Yeah! My dad was a programmer for#a big company.
> He always let me play around on his#computer.
> It's super loud and beepy! And the#keyboard is even louder!#Like... $sCLACK CLACK CLACK!!
> Ever since he's been gone, I've been#trying to program my own stuff.
> He had a bunch of old reference#guides that I've been reading.
< Have you made anything yet?
> A few small things. I want to try#making a video game sometime.
@< explain2
< That would be amazing!
> Are you into video games?
@< think
< Uh... sometimes we stop by arcades.
@< smile
< My witch is really good at that#game where you try to jump on all#the cubes.
------------------------
< What kind of job do you want to have?
> I'm not entirely sure.
> My grandpa always tries to get me#to join the fletching business with#him.
< Are you interested in that?
> Not really.
> My grandpa has taught me a bunch,#and he says I'm really good with my#hands.
> He thinks I would make a great#fletcher, or any other kind of#craftsperson.
> But... come on! Fletching?#Making small trinkets?
> That sounds like the most boring#job in the world.
> I mean, look at you! You get to help#a witch do magical stuff!
> Why can't I have a job as interesting#as that?
< Uh...
< $wYeah.
========================
> So, Cosmo...
> You and your witch are always, uh... $wtogether, $0right?
@< idle
< Yep. We got put on different trains, but we normally wouldn't split up.

[ 123 She's actually really nice. (-20, -60)[139, 153] | She's all right. (-20, -60)[139, 153] | She isn't very nice. (-20, -60)[139, 153]
------------------------
@< smile
< She's actually really nice.
< She doesn't usually treat me like an assistant or a familiar.
< She treats me more like a friend.
> Really?
< Yeah. I help her with her work, but we also do things together.
< We make things for each other's birthdays.#Sometimes we go on walks and talk about life.
< And she really likes to travel, so we go a lot of neat places.
> Aw... that's so sweet. It's almost like you're her son.
@< idle
< Uh... no. That's not how it works.
> Why not? You two are like a family.
< ...I guess.
------------------------
< She's all right.
< We don't talk too much. She just asks me to do stuff for her, and I do it.
< Not much more than that.
< I'm just a familiar, after all.
> Is she nice, though?
@< sad
< Well, yeah, but...
< It doesn't seem like she cares about me too much.
< It's not like I'm family to her or anything.

@< smile
< We still do stuff together, though!
@< idle
< Just not very often.
------------------------
@< sad
< She isn't very nice.
> What?!
< Yeah. She yells at me a lot, especially when I do things wrong.
< She calls me an "idiot" a lot of the time.
> How does she think she can do that?!
< I mean... I'm just her familiar. Her assistant.#Nothing more than that.
> Yeah, but...!
> Ugh.
> That makes me so mad...
@< heh
< $sS-$0she's not all bad, though!

< She still does nice things sometimes.
