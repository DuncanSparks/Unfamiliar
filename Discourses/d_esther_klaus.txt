@< explain2
< What do you two want to talk about?
@< smile
> Tell us about being a familiar!
@< idle
< What?
> Klaus, be quiet!

< You two sound like you're dying to ask me something.

> Okay, look, demon...
@< glare

@< idle
> KLAUS!

> Yeah. How $wdoes $0your witch treat you?
< ...
< What do you mean?
> Is she $wnice $0to you?
< I mean... yeah.
@< explain
< I'm her familiar, but a lot of the time she treats me more like a friend.
@< smile
< I help her with her work, but we also do lots of other stuff together.
> ...
> I knew it.
@< idle
< What?
> Ugh...
> Okay... here's the thing, demon.
@< angry
< I said my name is Cosmo.
> Our mom is thinking about creating her own familiar.
@< idle
< Really?
> And we don't want her to.
< ...Why not?
> Because...

@< angry
< Hey, would you mind not calling familiars "its?" Let alone to my face?
< We aren't objects. We're demons.
< We have souls, like you.
> ...
> Sorry.
@< idle
> We're just worried that our mom would start giving all her attention to her familiar.
@< glare
< And what makes you think she would do that?
> $sYou!
@< idle
> Your witch is like your mom.
@< angry
< When did I say that?
> You said she treats you more like her friend than her familiar!
> It's like you're her son.

@< angry2
< Okay, first off, don't call me a "son." I'm nonbinary.
< Second, I'm not her child. I'm her $sfamiliar.
@< angry
> But you said she's really nice to you!
@< angry2
< That doesn't mean $sanything!
@< angry
< My witch isn't like a lot of other witches.
< They treat their familiars like most people treat witches. Like trash.
@< angry2
< They do horrible things to them to make up for the horrible things that happen to them.
@< angry
> ...
> But... our mom is really nice!
<@ idle
> She would never hurt anyone!
> She loves us, and if she had a familiar, she would love them, too!
< ...
@< angry
< That doesn't matter.
@< sad
< I don't even know if my witch loves me.
> What?!
> If she's so nice to you, why wouldn't she?
@< angry2
< $sBecause I'm just her FAMILIAR!
@< cry
< $sI'm supposed to help her, and all I ever do is screw everything up.
< $sThis was supposed to be a nice trip, but instead we got separated, and I can't find her,
< $sand I forgot about Communion Day for the millionth time, and she probably hates me,
< $sbut it doesn't even matter, because I'm just her familiar. I'm not real family.
< $sHow can you be part of someone's family if you don't even know their name?
< $sYou two have nothing to worry about. You're more family to your mom than any familiar would be.
< $sAnd she'll never stop loving you, because you can't love a demon.
< You can't love a $sstupid eldritch abomination $0and a $swaste of space $0like me.
< $s...#...#...
< $sI'm sorry.
