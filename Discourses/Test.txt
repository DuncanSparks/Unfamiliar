------------------------
< Salem, up north.
< They don't really like witches and#demons up there.
< Our house almost got burned down.
@< sad
< Three times.
@< idle
< It's nice and cool, though.
< There are lots of trees. It's really#pretty.
> Have you ever considered moving?
< Not really. My witch has lived there#her whole life. It means too much to#her.
> I see...
------------------------
< Zzyzx, to the west.
> What a strange name!
@< smile
< Heh. Yeah.
< It's a small town in the middle of the#desert.
< The people there are pretty nice.
@< idle
< Although... $wweird $0people and#creatures pass through town#sometimes.
< And it's $shot. $0In the 90s all the time.
> What?!
< Farenheit.
> Oh. Right.
> Don't demons like it to be hot, or#something?
< I could take it or leave it.
------------------------
< Cottonwood, to the east.
> Oh, that's pretty close!
@< smile
< Yeah. We actually visit Los Muertos#a lot.
@< idle
< Cottonwood is just so boring.
< At least, I think so. I don't know if#my witch cares.
========================
<< Hey, Rhona...
[ 87 Where are you from? (-20, -60)[53, 60] | Why are you visiting Los Muertos? (20, -10)[62, 72] | Where are your parents? (0, 40)[74, 85]
------------------------
< Where are you from?
> I'm from Phoenix.
< Wow, really? That's a big city.
> Yep! I'm not sure how much I like it,#though.
> People aren't too nice in that city.#Everyone's always irritated about#something.
> I mean, it's pretty beautiful, but...#it also just $wfeels $0crummy.#I'm not sure why.
> I think Los Muertos is a lot more fun.
< I can see why!
------------------------
< Why are you visiting Los Muertos?
> I come here every few months to visit#my grandpa.
> He works here as a fletcher.#Ainsley's Fletching.
< Oh, that place?
< My witch and I always walk past it.
< It's not like she buys arrows or#anything, but...
< I always look through the windows.
> Yeah. My grandpa is a wizard.
< Really?
> A wizard at interior decorating.
< Ha!
------------------------
< Where are your parents?
> They're not here. I usually come to#Los Muertos by myself.
> My dad passed away a few years ago.
< Oh...
> And my mom...
> She really doesn't like to see my#grandpa.
> They disagree on a lot of things.
< That must be hard...
> Yeah.
> She also just doesn't like Los#Muertos.
> She says it's too... $wesoteric $0for her.
< I guess that's understandable.
========================
> Hey, Cosmo.
> You said you were a familiar, right?
< Yeah.
> What does that mean, exactly?
@< whatnow
< Well, uh...
@< idle
< My witch just... $wcreated $0me, because#she wanted a personal assistant.
> I thought all demons were from the...#underworld, or something?
< Not exactly. It's really complicated.
> Oh. All right.
>> So, what does your witch $wdo, $0exactly?
[ 136 She teaches people magic. (-20, -60)[101, 112] | She makes and sells potions. (20, -10)[114, 123] | She writes books of hexes. (0, 40)[125, 134]
------------------------
< She teaches people magic.
> Wait... you can just $wteach $0people#magic?
> I thought you had to be born a witch,#or something.
< Surprisingly not. Anyone can#become a witch with enough#training.
< Anyone human, that is.
> Does she teach at a school?
< Nope. She homeschools kids in our#town who want to learn magic.
> And what about you? Has she taught#you magic?
< Oh, there's no need for that.#I already know magic.
> $wWOOW! $0That was cool!
> Maybe I should become a witch.
< Uh... might want to think about that#for a while.
------------------------
< She makes and sells potions.
< Healing potions, enhancement#potions...
> $wLove $0potions?
< No. Those are only in movies.
> Oh.
> What does she make them with?
< Uh... lots of weird ingredients I#don't know anything about.
< I don't even know if she gets all her#ingredients legally.
< ...Don't tell her I told you that.
> My lips are sealed!
------------------------
< She writes books of hexes.
< You can't cast a spell without#knowing how, after all.
> So... books of magic words?
< Not exactly. They're more like#pentagrams. Patterns you have to#know.
> Do you... $wdraw $0them somewhere?
< You can.
< Or you can think about them $wreally#$0hard. It takes practice to do that,#though.
> Interesting!
> Is she a good writer?
< Yeah. She has a real way with words.

<< What about you, Rhona?
[ 169 What do you like to do? (-20, -60)[139, 153] | What kind of job do you want to have? (20, 60)[155, 167]

< Uh... sometimes we stop by arcades.
< My witch is really good at that#game where you try to jump on all#the cubes.

< Are you interested in that?
> Not really.
> My grandpa has taught me a bunch,#and he says I'm really good with my#hands.
> He thinks I would make a great#fletcher, or any other kind of#craftsperson.
