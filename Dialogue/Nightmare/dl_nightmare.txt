Why are you even bothering?
Do you really think she'll accept your apology?

Cosmo: Yes.

2
You've forgotten four times.
Four times, Cosmo!
FOUR TIMES!
You remember how mad she was last time.
You've used up all your second chances.
She won't forgive you.
-

3
But why would she stop there?
She's probably done with you.
She won't ever talk to you again.
She'll HATE you.

Oh, God... Oh, God...

You said it yourself. You always screw everything up.
And who would want a familiar that can't do a single thing right?
-

She won't forgive you.
She'll never talk to you again.
She won't want to see your face ever again.
Maybe she'll even kill you.
Cosmo: SHE WOULDN'T DO THAT!
Why?
There's nothing stopping her.

She doesn't love you.
She never loved you.
You remember, don't you?
She doesn't know what those words mean.
They don't mean anything.
Someone just made them up, because they sounded profound.

"Love lasts in the longest shadows?"
It's drivel.
Like the tagline of a stupid video game.
-

9
You aren't her family. You're a familiar.
A tool.
And you can't even do that right.
-

10
You're an abomination.
Hellspawn.
Trash.
You deserve to die.
Why don't you just die?
