Witch: Can I HELP YOU, honeybucket?
Cosmo: Uh...
Cosmo: You're a witch, right?
Witch: ...
Witch: Don't I look like one, newt nose?
Witch: Everyone else knows I'm a witch. And I never hear the end of it.
Witch: I'd think a demon would figure it out.
Cosmo: Sorry...
Cosmo: What's your name?

Yaga: Your witch must be pretty stupid if she didn't tell you that.

Cosmo: Why not?

Yaga: I said I'm busy, snake breath!
Cosmo: All you're doing is eating dinner!

Yaga: I haven't eaten all day, halibut head!
Yaga: Can't a witch enjoy something for once?

Yaga: Everyone always tries to drag me into something stupid!

Yaga: I've got much better things to do than help some demon jerk!
