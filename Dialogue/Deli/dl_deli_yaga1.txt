Witch: Can I HELP YOU, honeybucket?
Cosmo: Uh...
Cosmo: You're a witch, right?
Witch: ...
Witch: Don't I look like one, newt nose?
Witch: Everyone else knows I'm a witch. And I never hear the end of it.
Witch: I'd think a demon would realize it.
Cosmo: Sorry...
Cosmo: What's your name?
Witch: Yaga.
Yaga: What do you want? I'm very busy.
Cosmo: Doing what?
Yaga: Waiting for my dinner.
Cosmo: ...What are you eating for dinner?
Yaga: Why do you care?
Cosmo: ...
Yaga: ...
Yaga: A sandwich. Happy?

Yaga: Man... you're really persistent, kid.
Cosmo: ...
Cosmo: Have you seen my witch?
Yaga: Excuse me?
Yaga: You ordered one too?
Cosmo: What?
Cosmo: ...No. Not my sandwich. My witch... witch.
Cosmo: She's wearing a bright yellow coat.
Cosmo: If I don't find her soon, she'll be-
Yaga: Wait. You're a familiar?
Yaga: What are you doing away from your witch, hamster hair?
Yaga: That's the first rule familiars should know. Attend your witch at all times.
Yaga: Your witch must be pretty stupid if she didn't tell you that.
Cosmo: She's not STUPID! I know I'm not supposed to be away from her!
Cosmo: I've been her familiar for over seven years!
Cosmo: We got separated because we had to get on different trains!

Yaga: Look, honeybucket. I don't have time to help you.
Cosmo: Why not?
Yaga: I'm busy, snake breath!
Cosmo: All you're doing is eating dinner!
Yaga: I haven't eaten all day, halibut head! Can't a witch enjoy something for once?
Yaga: At least I'm not an inconsiderate demon jerk walking around and butting into
other people's conversations because he couldn't be bothered to stay with his witch!

Cosmo: It's "they."
Cosmo: That's the least you could get right if you're going to insult me.

Yaga: Sorry.
Yaga: I didn't mean to make you upset.
Cosmo: I'm sure you didn't.

Yaga: OK, don't get snide on me, hamster hair.
Yaga: Just tell me about your witch. I might be able to help.
Yaga: This place's sandwiches are garbage, anyway. I can wait on eating dinner.
