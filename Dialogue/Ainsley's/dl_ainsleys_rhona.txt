Rhona: My grandpa really likes demons.
Cosmo: Really?
Rhona: Yeah! Apparently lots of demons come into his shop.
He says there's this one demon he sees a lot who's really into small gadgets.
She always comes in to talk with him about it.
He says she can really talk his ear off... but he doesn't mind.
He'd happily talk with her all day. He loves talking about his craft.
Cosmo: That's really nice of him.
Rhona: Yeah. My grandpa's great.
