Rhona: My grandpa really likes demons.
Cosmo: Really?
Rhona: Yeah! Apparently lots of demons come into the shop.
Rhona: He says there's this one young demon he sees a lot.
Rhona: She's really into small gadgets, and she always comes in to talk with him about it.

Cosmo: That's really nice of him.
Rhona: Yeah. My grandpa's great.
