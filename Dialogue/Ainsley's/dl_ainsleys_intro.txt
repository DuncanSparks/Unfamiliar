Cosmo: Hey, Rhona!
Rhona: Good to see you again!

Rhona's Grandpa: What was your name? Cosmo?
Cosmo: Yeah.
Rhona's Grandpa: I'm Paul, Rhona's grandfather. Nice to meet you.
Rhona told me a lot about you.
She seemed very excited that she got to talk to you.

Cosmo: Heh... yeah.
Rhona told me a bit about you, too.
She told me you're an amazing interior decorator.
Paul: Ha! Did she?
Well... I try my best to make this place look nice.

Rhona: So, what are you doing here, Cosmo?
Have you found your witch?

Cosmo: No.
I'm not sure where to go.
Paul: Oh, you're a familiar?
Cosmo: Yeah. My witch and I got separated.
She's not going to be happy if I take too long to find her.
Paul: She'll definitely turn up. She's probably looking for you, too.
Cosmo: Ugh...

Rhona: You're stressing out too much.
You should take a break. Do something to take your mind off it.
Cosmo: ...Like what?
Rhona: Help us fix some stuff!
Cosmo: What?
Rhona: My grandpa repairs small trinkets.
I always help him with some of them when I come and visit, to make some money.
And... six hands are always better than four!
Cosmo: I, uh...
I'd probably be pretty hopeless at that.

Rhona: Don't worry! We can teach you!
Cosmo: ...
Well... I do know a bit of magic...
Rhona: Oh, really?! That's even better!
And I'm sure if you helped out, Grandpa would give you some money, too!
Paul: I sure will!
Cosmo: Hm...
Rhona: Think about it, okay? Let us know if you want to give it a try!

Rhona: Don't worry! We can teach you!
Besides, you know magic, right? That'll be helpful!
Cosmo: ...
Paul: If you're willing to help, there'll be some money in it for you!
Cosmo: Hm...
Rhona: Think about it, okay? Let us know if you want to give it a try!
