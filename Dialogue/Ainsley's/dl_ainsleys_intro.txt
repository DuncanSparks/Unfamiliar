Rhona's Grandpa: What was your name? Cosmo?

She's not going to be happy if I take too long to find her.
I don't know what to do.
Paul: I wouldn't worry. She'll definitely turn up.
She's probably looking for you, too.
Cosmo: Ugh...

Cosmo: ...Like what?
Rhona: Help us fix some stuff!
Cosmo: What?

Rhona: This is a repair shop. My grandpa repairs small trinkets.
I always help him out a bit when I come and visit. He pays me for it.
And six hands are always better than four!
Cosmo: I, uh...
I'd probably be pretty hopeless at that.

Rhona: Don't worry! We can teach you!
Cosmo: ...
Well... I do know a bit of magic.
Rhona: Oh, really?! That's even better!
And I'm sure if you helped out, Grandpa would give you some money, too!
Paul: I sure will!
Cosmo: Hm...
Rhona: Think about it, okay? Let us know if you want to give it a try!

Rhona: Don't worry! We can teach you!
Besides, you know magic, right? That'll be helpful!
Cosmo: ...
Paul: If you're willing to help, there'll be some money in it for you!
Cosmo: Hm...
Rhona: Think about it, okay? Let us know if you want to give it a try!
