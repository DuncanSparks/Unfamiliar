Merchant: Hey, kid. How's a fellow demon doing?
Cosmo: Not terrible.
I'm looking for my witch, though.
Have you seen her? She's wearing a yellow coat.
Merchant: Nope. I'll keep an eye out, though.
What's your name, kid?
Cosmo: Cosmo.
Merchant: Pace.
Cosmo: Are you new here?
I don't remember you from the last time my witch and I visited.
Pace: Oh, I travel all over the place.
I always bring this table with me. I sell all kinds of bits and bobs.
You interested in anything?
Cosmo: Maybe. I'll have a look.
