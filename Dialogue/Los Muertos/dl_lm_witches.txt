Witch A: How is Mabel doing?
Witch B: Wonderfully. She's taking her SATs this month.
Witch A: Oh, wish her luck for me!
Do you think she's almost ready to-
Witch B: No.
Witch A: Really?
Witch B: My father started training me way too early. I hated it.
I'll let her start when she's ready.
Or maybe she doesn't even want to be a witch. That'd be fine with me.

Witch A: You'd be fine with her not following in your footsteps?
Witchcraft usually runs in the entire family.
Witch B: Berthe, you know being a witch isn't everything.
Chaining your soul to the underworld is a commitment.
Witch A: Well, when you put it that way...

Witch A: Is she interested in being a witch?
Witch B: To be honest, I've hardly asked her.
I think she likes the idea of having a familiar.
She isn't great at making friends...
She's said that a familiar could be her best friend.
Witch A: Is that... healthy for her?
Witch B: What?
Witch A: To make friends with her familiar instead of other people?
Witch B: Um... what's wrong with that?
Witch A: ...
Nothing. You're right.
