Keifer: Are you going to be here tomorrow?
Cosmo: Yeah. Why?
Keifer: I'm gonna finish this roll tomorrow and get it developed.
Keifer: So I could show you my pictures of you, if you want.
Cosmo: Sure!
Cosmo: ...Hopefully I'll find my witch by then.
Keifer: I bet you will.

Cosmo: I should probably get back to that.
Keifer: Oh... okay.

Keifer: ...Anyway.
Keifer: Hopefully I'll see you tomorrow, Cosmo.
Keifer: Good luck finding your witch!
Cosmo: Thanks! See you later!
