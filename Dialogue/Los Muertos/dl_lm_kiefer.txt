Resident: O-oh. H-hi, demon.
You, uh... weren't supposed to see that.
Cosmo: Why'd you just take a picture of me?
Resident: Oh, y'know... I, uh...
I do photography. I really like taking portraits on the street.
I've never taken a portrait of a demon before.
And that was the perfect opportunity!
...You are a demon, right?
Cosmo: Yeah. I'm a familiar.
Resident: What? Really? Oh... uh...
Y-you're not gonna, like... tell your witch about me, are you?
Cosmo: What? No.
I don't care that you took my picture.

Resident: Well, then what're you scaring me for?!
Heh, heh... Anyway.
I'm Keifer. Who're you?
Cosmo: Cosmo.
Keifer: Hey, Cosmo! What're you up to?
Cosmo: I'm trying to find my witch. We got separated.
Keifer: Aw, man... That sucks.
Cosmo: Yeah. She's probably not very happy right now.
Keifer: How'd you get separated?
Cosmo: We were getting on the train to come here.
There was only one seat left.
I had to wait an hour for another train to show up.
Keifer: Ah. Gotcha.
I wouldn't worry about it. It's not like it was your fault.
Cosmo: ...
Yeah. You're right.
Keifer: Maybe you should take a break from looking for her.
Want to talk for a bit?
Cosmo: Sure!
