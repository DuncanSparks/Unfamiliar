Ariad: Thanks, Cosmo.
Cosmo: Hey, like I said: Anything to help a fellow familiar out.

Ariad's Witch: I didn't think you'd walk off.
Ariad: I-I'm s-sorry. P-please don't-

I got everything at the bank sorted out.
Ariad: ...

Ariad's Witch: Is everything all right?
Were people mean to you?
Ariad: N-no! I was just talking to Cosmo, here.
They kept me company. They're a familiar, too.

Ariad's Witch: Really?

Cosmo: Yeah.
I've been looking for my witch. We got separated.
Ariad's Witch: Oh...
Cosmo: And she was in such a bad mood before we got here.
I'm just as worried as Ariad was.
I'm worried she's mad at me. That it was something I did.

Ariad's Witch: Cosmo... I wouldn't worry about it.
If you don't know why she was mad, it probably isn't your fault.
Cosmo: ...
Yeah. You're right.

Ariad's Witch: Well... we should get going.
We have some things to do tonight, right, Ariad?
Ariad: Y-yeah.

Ariad's Witch: Hey...
Thanks for keeping him company.
He's... really clingy.
But he's so friendly. He really loves hugs.
Cosmo: I noticed.
Ariad's Witch: I don't know why he's like that.

Cosmo: I mean... familiars inherit a lot from their witches.
Maybe you were like that at one point.
Ariad's Witch: If I was... it was a long time ago.

Ariad's Witch: If you'd like to come and visit later, feel free.
We live on the west side of Los Muertos.
Cosmo: All right.
Ariad's Witch: My name is Clive, by the way.
Just don't say that in front of Ariad.
Cosmo: Of course.

Clive: See you around. Good luck finding your witch.
Cosmo: Thanks. See you later!
