Ariad's Witch: Sorry that took so long.
Ariad: W-what happened at the bank?
Ariad's Witch: Don't worry. I got everything sorted out.
Ariad: Oh...

Ariad: N-no! I was just talking to Cosmo, here.

Cosmo: Yeah.
Cosmo: I've been looking for my witch. We got separated.
Ariad's Witch: Oh...
Cosmo: She was also in a bad mood before we got here.
Cosmo: I just hope it wasn't something I did.

Ariad's Witch: Well...
Ariad's Witch: If you don't know why she was mad, it probably wasn't you.
Cosmo: ...I guess not.
Cosmo: I need to stop worrying so much.
Ariad's Witch: Nothing wrong with worrying.
Ariad's Witch: Just don't beat yourself up over it.
Cosmo: ...Yeah.

Ariad's Witch: Thanks for keeping him company.
Cosmo: No problem.
Cosmo: He's a pretty interesting character.
Ariad's Witch: Yeah. He's... really clingy.
Ariad's Witch: But he's so friendly. He really loves hugs.
Cosmo: I noticed.
Ariad's Witch: I don't know why he's like that.

Cosmo: I mean... familiars inherit a lot from their witches.
Cosmo: Maybe you were like that at one point.
Ariad's Witch: If I was... it was a long time ago.

Ariad's Witch: Well...
Ariad's Witch: If you'd like to come and visit later, feel free.
Ariad's Witch: We live on the west side of Los Muertos.
Cosmo: All right.
Ariad's Witch: My name is Clive, by the way.
Clive: Just don't say that in front of Ariad.
Cosmo: Of course.

Cosmo: Thanks. See you later!
