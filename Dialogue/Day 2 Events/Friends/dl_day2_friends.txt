Witch: Oh, hello!
Other Witch: Hi!
Woman: Hello!
Third Witch: You must be-
Young Boy: Is that a demon?!
Young Girl: Klaus, calm down.

Cosmo: Heh... hi.
Man: Are you-
Witch: Shhhh! Geoff, I told you.
You can't say a witch's name in front of their familiar.
Geoff: Right. My bad.
So he's her familiar?
Other Witch: They.
Geoff: Huh?
...
Oh. Sorry.
They're her familiar?
Other Witch: Yes.

Cosmo: ...
Thanks.

Witch: It's been so long since we've seen her.
I don't think she even had you the last time.
She's told us a lot about you, though.
What was your name, again?
Cosmo: Cosmo.
Witch: Cosmo! That's right.
I'm Hildred.
Other Witch: Jay.
Geoff: Geoff.
Woman: Call me Kaz.
Third Witch: I'm Penelope.

Young Girl: ...
I'm Esther.

Esther: Klaus, come on. Introduce yourself.
Penelope: Honey...

Penelope: His name's Klaus. He's a little shy.
Cosmo: Yeah. No worries.

Jay: Why don't you sit down, Cosmo?
We saved a seat for you and your witch.
Kaz: Where is she, anyway?
Cosmo: ...You haven't seen her yet?
Kaz: Nope. We've been here for about half an hour, and she hasn't shown up.
Cosmo: ...
She must be running late.

Cosmo: So, what have I missed?
Penelope: Oh, not much. We've just been talking.
Esther is enjoying her first year of high school.
Cosmo: Oh, she just started high school? Neat!
Esther: Did you even go to high school?
Cosmo: ...No. My witch homeschooled me.
What grade are you in, Klaus?
-

Klaus: ...
Fourth.
Cosmo: Nice.

UHHHHH MORE DIALOGUE HERE??
-

11
Kaz: You know... I'm getting a little tired of sitting around.
Penelope: Honestly, me too.
Should we take a walk around Los Muertos?
It's such a pretty city, and I'd like to see more of it.
Jay: I'm down.
Kaz: Sounds good!
Hildred: I'll come, too.
Geoff: I... think I'll stay here.
-

12
Jay: What's the matter, Geoff? Afraid of walking with the witches?
Geoff: What? No! I'm just... really tired.
...
Oh, fine. I'll come, too.
-

13
Esther: Do we have to come?
Penelope: Yes, you two. Everyone else is going.
Esther: But we've been walking all day!
Klaus: Yeah!
-

14
Cosmo: I can stay here and watch them.
I was walking around town all of last night, anyway.
Penelope: Oh, Cosmo, you'd be willing to do that?
You're such a saint.
-

15
Klaus: What?! You're gonna leave us alone with the demon?
Esther: Klaus, shut up.
-

16
Penelope: OK, I don't want to hear any of that from either of you.
Cosmo is being nice enough to offer to stay here with you.
So you can either stay here with them or come on a walk with us.
Esther: ...
Fine. We'll stay.
-

17
Penelope: We'll be back in about half an hour.
Be good.

18
WHERE SHOULD WE GO FIRST?? LA LA LA

19
Cosmo: ...
Well... looks like we've got some time to kill.
You two want to talk about anything?
Klaus: ...
Esther: ...
Sure.
