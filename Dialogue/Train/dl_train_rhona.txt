Cosmo: ...Hi.
Commuter: What's wrong? You look kinda down.
Cosmo: ...
Cosmo: My witch and I got separated. We had to get on different trains.
Commuter: Your witch?
Commuter: Does that mean you're a familiar?
Cosmo: Yes.
Commuter: Oh... do you need help finding her?
Cosmo: I don't think so. I can probably find her myself.
Commuter: ...
Commuter: Well, before you leave, we should talk a bit!
Cosmo: What?
Commuter: I'm Rhona. What's your name?
Cosmo: Cosmo.
Rhona: Nice to meet you, Cosmo!

Cosmo: Why do you want to talk to me?
Rhona: Because you're a demon! Demons are cool!
Cosmo: ...You think so?
Cosmo: Most people call us eldritch abominations.
Rhona: Oh, brother...
Rhona: You don't look like an "abomination" to me.
Rhona: You seem really nice. I want to learn more about you!
Cosmo: ...
Cosmo: I'm not very good at talking.
Rhona: Oh, don't worry.
Rhona: I'll show you how it's done!
