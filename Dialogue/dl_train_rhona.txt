Commuter: Oh, it's a demon! Hi, demon!
Cosmo: Um... hi.
Commuter: Are you a familiar?
Cosmo: Yes.
I'm not sure where my witch is. She was on a different train.
Commuter: Oh... do you need help finding her?
Cosmo: No. I can probably find her myself.
Commuter: ...
Well, before you leave, we should talk a bit!
Cosmo: What?
Commuter: I'm Rhona. What's your name?
Cosmo: My name's... Cosmo.
Rhona: Nice to meet you, Cosmo!
Cosmo: Why do you want to talk to me?
Rhona: Because you're a demon! Demons are cool!
Cosmo: I can't remember the last time someone said that.
Most people call us eldritch abominations.
And they're probably right.
Rhona: I don't care if you're an eldritch abomination!
I still want to learn more about you!
Cosmo: I'm not very good at talking.
Rhona: Oh, don't worry.
I'll show you how it's done!
